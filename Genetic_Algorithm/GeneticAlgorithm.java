// I used a 'Melody' class that works in a similar fasion to the normal 'Gene' class 
// and instead of a 'Population' class I created a 'Composition' class.
// The compositon class groups multiple melodies with a possible idea being to eventually mutate 
// melodies in order to return a target piece of music.
